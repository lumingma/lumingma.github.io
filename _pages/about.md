I'm a fourth year Ph.D student working with [Zhigang Deng](http://graphics.cs.uh.edu/zdeng/) in the [Computer Graphics and Interactive Media Lab](http://graphics.cs.uh.edu/) at University of Houston. My research focus on computer graphics especially on facial reconstruction, expression transformation and transferring on monocular RGB camera.
